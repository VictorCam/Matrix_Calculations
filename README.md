## Matrix Calculations

OSU Operating Systems 1 Project. We were constrained to use certain bash
commands in order to generate matrix operations.

After this project, I took some time to create a C++ version of the matrix multiplication.

## Note

The "matrix" file is the bash file and the "matrix.cpp" is the C++ file

## Example

(result of C++ version in "results" file)
